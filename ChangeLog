Reran nudging experiments with tag~cam6_4_109. Created new cam snapshots. This Unit test is still bit-for-bit with full model.
      Modified atm_in.
      Added subdir for cam_files and placed copy of latest nugding run user_nl_cam.
      Added this file.

This Unit test is still bit-for-bit with full model(cam6_4_109), including new movmtn calculation.
     Added gw_movmtn_calc.F90 to reproduce moving mountain scheme.
     Added code to run from XY meterological data - currently regrdded 1/8 degree fields on fv1x1.
     Also added code to calculate vorticity from XY U and V (utils/sphere_ops.F90).
     Modified atm_in, cleaned up namelist. Using 'top_ctl_nl' with 'calculation_type'.

Might tag this.

This Unit test in "snapshot" mode is still at round-off equality with full model(cam6_4_109). Note here
     that it was never actually bit-for-bit ... (my bad ..:( ).
     Moving to netcdf output - added utils/nc_flexout_mod.F90
     Keeping fortran writes until this is tagged (v2.1) and then will remove them. Also want to modify
     controls.
