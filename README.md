# GW_UnitTest
Test harness for GW codes

Fortan infrastructure from cam (more or less tag=cam6_4_055) to allow gravity wave codes to be run in Unit test mode.

Names of cam files have not been changed, although many have been dramatically hacked to simplify build.

SOme new files have been created that are not in cam code base.

At some a guide to the provenance of each file will be provided ... but not this day ...
